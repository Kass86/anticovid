PREDICTION:
1. Difine problem:
    - How many new cases are confirmed tomorrow?
    - In order to answer the above question. We use a basic Machine Learning Algorithm that is Linear Regression.
2. Our data:
    - Data's description here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data
    - Covid19 Dashboard here: https://datastudio.google.com/s/sR3DrBad-v8

    - Because the data collection has a large noise, we will use the smoothing data (7-day smoothed) to be `target` feature.
    
3. Feature selection:
    - We choose some `train` features that have high correlation metrics and we'll use data of 14 days previous to train model.
    
4. Model evaluation:
